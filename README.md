# Digsilent Load Flow Simulation with Python

This repository contains documents and resources demonstrating how to perform load flow simulations in DIgSILENT PowerFactory using Python. The examples are based on a wind farm case study from DIgSILENT and include:

- **Load Flow Simulation:** Using Python scripting to run and analyze load flow results.
- **Fault Ride Through (FRT):** Demonstration of FRT analysis using the DIgSILENT GUI.

## Contents
- Python scripts for automating load flow analysis.
- Documentation for setting up the wind farm simulation.
- DIgSILENT GUI instructions for Fault Ride Through analysis.

## Usage
